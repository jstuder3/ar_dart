# AR Dart - An Augmented Reality version of Darts for the HoloLens 2

Play Darts - with a twist. This version of Darts is played with a HoloLens and doesn't require any dangerous pointy objects. Simply place the dart board on a wall and start throwing darts at it.

Augmented Reality makes it possible to play Darts like never before, for example with gravity modifiers that make your dart fly upwards rather than down. 

Below is a link to a demo video as well as a screenshot from the game.
